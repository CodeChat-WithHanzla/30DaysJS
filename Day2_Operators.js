/**  Feature Request:
 1. Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations perations (addition, (addition, subtraction, subt multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.
 2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that at compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.
 3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
